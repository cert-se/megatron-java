v1.0.11 [to be released]
=======
* New: The following job types (configurations) are new:
    - ikyon
    - brobot
    - brobot2
    - ddos-amplification
    - ip-flowing-fast
    - ip-flowing-verbose
    - shadowserver-openresolver
    - shadowserver-qotd
    - shadowserver-chargen
    - shadowserver-sinkhole-http-drone
    - shadowserver-netbios
    - shadowserver-snmp
    - shadowserver-microsoft-sinkhole

* Improved: The following job types (configurations) are improved:
    - shadowserver-sinkhole-http-drone
    - ip-flowing

* New: Organization report is target for organizations with a huge volume of 
  abuse cases, e.g. ISPs and web hotels. Instead of getting one email per data 
  source, they will receive one report every 24 hours that is machine parsable.

* New: Log entries in mail body are now also included as an attachment in a 
  standardized format that is machine parsable.

* New: MultithreadedDnsProcessor makes DNS lookups and reverse lookups in 
  several threads to increase performance. See the following configurations:
  ip-flowing and ip-flowing-verbose. 

* New: Filter log entries by occurrence (OccurrenceFilter), e.g. "include first
  20 matches of the same IP address" or "include log entries with more than 10 
  occurrences of the same URL".

* New: Added rewriters for both parser and export (parser.rewriters, 
  export.rewriters). Example: can rewrite URLs from "http" to "hxxp",
  or mask IP addresses (10.20.x.x).

* New: Added property (rss.job.enabled) to turn on/off writing to job RSS file.

* New: Support for Windows epoch ("Windows NT time format").  
  Set "parser.timestampFormat" to "windowsEpoch".  

* Improved: ip-flowing splitted in 3 configs (ip-flowing, ip-flowing-fast, 
  ip-flowing-verbose). Easier to select output and lookups.

* Improved: Template files are cached which will increase performance. 

* Improved: Added additional indices to megatron-schema.sql that will increase
  performance for quarantine SQL queries. 

* Improved: If quarantine is turned off (mail.ipQuarantinePeriod=0) no SQL
  queries for quarantine checking are executed. Configuration for each job in 
  --job-list is loaded.  

* Improved: Remove diacritics (accents) from city name (filename for JSON-files
  in GeolocationJsonReportGenerator).

* Improved: Removed references to "sitic_footer.txt" in all job types. Added
  "general_footer.txt" in "megatron_globals.properties" instead.  

* Improved: Support for Java 1.5 and 1.6 dropped (have reached end-of-life).
  Source and target is now 1.7.  

* Improved: Source is now 1.7 compatible. Added @override for interface methods.

* Improved: Tested with MariaDB. Worked without any problem.

* Improved: Failed DNS lookups are now logged with debug-level.

* Bug: RuntimeException is thrown from GeoIP API (IP to ASN lookup).

* Bug: Using UTF-8 in megatron.sh (e.g. generated filenames will be in UTF-8). 

* Moved repository to GitHub:
  - Modified Ant-script (build.xml)
  - All files have now Unix line endings (except files in doc/ and sql/) 
  - Documentation improved

v1.0.10
=======
* New: Support for MaxMind's ASN database. Add AS number and AS name to a log 
  entry. See AsnGeoIpDecorator. Works together with old AsnDecorator.
  
* New: Support for MaxMind's City database. Add geolocation (latitude, 
  longitude, city etc.) to a log record. See GeolocationDecorator.    
  Country lookup can either use the City database (commercial or free),
  or the Country database (commercial or free). See GeoIpCountryManager.

* New: Support for decorators in file export and mail export.

* New: Support for XML and JSON reports with geolocation data 
  (see GeolocationXmlReportGenerator, GeolocationJsonReportGenerator). 

* New: Support for customized reports (see report.classNames).

* New: Add country code from hostname (see CountryCodeFromHostnameDecorator).
  CombinedDecorator uses now this decorator plus CountryCodeDecorator 
  (IP --> country code) to maximize country hits (e.g. for SE).

* New: Script that sends unsent jobs in batch (see mega-sender.py).

* Bug: Date-header is missing in mail. Solution: Sets date explicit 
  (setSentDate) in MailSender.
  
* Bug: Invalid email address terminates application. Solution: Email addresses
  are checked before sending.  

* Improved: Better DNS query performance:
  - New faster implementation of reverse DNS lookup (uses SimpleResolver) 
  - javadns-class library updated to version 2.1.3.
  - New properties: DNS servers, time-out, and implementation.  

* Improved: Decorators used in CombinedDecorator are now specified in the
  property 'decorator.combinedDecorator.classNames'.  

* Improved: All manager-classes that handles a MaxMind database are singletons
  to reduce memory footprint.

* Improved: Better performance when checking if IP is in quarantine:
    - Added caching in JobListWriter.isAllQuarantined
    - Honor --use-org2 in JobListWriter.isAllQuarantined

* Improved: UTF-8 is used in stdout and properties-files:
    - stdout: file.encoding=UTF-8 is defined in megatron.sh
    - properties-files: Must be in UTF-8 format if non-ASCII characters are used.

* Improved: Possible to keep temporary files for debugging purpose (see 
  fileProcessor.deleteTmpFiles).  

* Improved: fileMapperList updated due to changes in filenames from Shadowserver.

* Refactored: JobManager and AbstractExportManager uses the same code.
  See LogEntryFilterManager and DecoratorManager.
